This is a machine learning library developed bt XIN YAO for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

1. For the LMS: you can set all the parameters like learning rate, and accuracy bond at the Linear.py file, and also choose the different algorithms by select the sepcific functions from linear_function.py file.
2. For Adaboost: I finish the adaboost function at the functions.py file, you can check whether the algorithm is correct based on the theory method. In practice, I didn't finish all code on time, so the HW2.py can call the Adaboost function, but can not run for it.
